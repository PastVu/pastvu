## History

This project was started in 2009 by Ilya Varlamov and Alexey Duk. Initially it
was dedicated to historical photos of Moscow (oldmos.ru). As community was
growing, soon a second site for historical photos of St. Petersburg was
created (oldsp.ru). In 2013 two projects were merged and migrated into global
scope platform PastVu. Principal maintainer and software architect of the new
platform became [Pavel Klimashkin](https://github.com/klimashkin). In 2020 the
project code [became](https://pastvu.com/news/149) open source, this attracted more
people to participate and contribute. Over the years, many people have
uploaded, attributed and geo-located images (photographs, paintings,
drawings), with support and leading by regional and global moderators and
administrators team.
